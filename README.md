# CS210_Project_3
//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project aimed to produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased, produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day, and produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased, all while integrating Python with C++.

//What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I wrote the code pretty well. I had a lot of issues at first, but after (many) Google searches and hours on StackOverflow, I was able to compile it successfully and get the program working the way it was supposed to.

//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could better optimize the integration of Python and C++. I had a lot of trouble getting Visual Studio to work with Python on my machine, and even towards the end of the project, I had to update Visual Studio to the latest firmware, and it no longer wanted to read the Python file. It was just very strange and a very frustrating experience.

//Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
If I am being honest, the whole thing was very challenging. Particularly producing the text-based histogram. It was a trial-and-error sort of experience. Like I said above, Google and StackOverflow were my best friends during this project.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Everything I have done throughout this entire class will transfer into other projects and course work, however I think the ability to combine two or more languages will be of most importance. I think that it opens up so many opportunities to use the best things of certain languages together into one project.

//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I wrote concise, industry-standard code. That was one thing I wanted to improve on this class, and I have come a far way since module one.
